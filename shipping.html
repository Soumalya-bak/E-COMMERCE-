        <p> What are the delivery charges?</p>
    </b>
    <p>
        Delivery charge varies with each Seller.
        Sellers incur relatively higher shipping costs on low value items. In such cases, charging a nominal delivery
        charge helps them offset logistics costs. Please check your order summary to understand the delivery charges for
        individual products.
    </p>
    <b>
        <p> Why does the delivery date not correspond to the delivery timeline of X-Y business days?</p>
    </b>
    <p>It is possible that the Seller or our courier partners have a holiday between the day your placed your order and
        the date of delivery, which is based on the timelines shown on the product page. In this case, we add a day to
        the estimated date. Some courier partners and Sellers do not work on Sundays and this is factored in to the
        delivery dates.

        <p>
            What is the estimated delivery time?
        </p>
    </b>
    <p>Sellers generally procure and ship the items within the time specified on the product page. Business days exclude
        public holidays and Sundays.</p>
    <p>
        Estimated delivery time depends on the following factors:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Seller offering the product.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Product's availability with the Seller.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The destination to which you want the order shipped to and location of the Seller.</li>
    </ul>

        <p>
            Why does the estimated delivery time vary for each seller?
        </p>
    </b>
    <p>
        You have probably noticed varying estimated delivery times for sellers of the product you are interested in.Delivery times are influenced by product availability, geographic location of the Seller, your shipping destination and the courier partner's time-to-deliver in your location.
