    The customer can choose to cancel an order any time before it's dispatched. The order cannot be canceled once itâ€™s out for delivery. However, the customer may choose to reject it at the doorstep.

In some cases, the customer may not be allowed to cancel the order for free, post the specified time and a cancellation fee will be charged. The details about the time window mentioned on the product page or order confirmation page will be considered final.

In case of any cancellation from the seller due to unforeseen circumstances, a full refund will be initiated for prepaid orders.</p>
